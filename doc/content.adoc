== Introduction

This is an implementation of functional references modeled as functions (in the same
way as transducers). Is a generalization of get and put mapping to the particular
part of a data structure.

Please, see <<quick-start, Quick Start>> section in order to understand it better
seeing some example code.

NOTE: This documentation does not covers all api, so if you miss some function,
contributions are very welcome. You can see the full link:api/index.html#id[API documentation here].


=== Project Maturity

Since _lentes_ is a young project there can be some API breakage.


=== Install

The simplest way to use _lentes_ in a clojure project, is by including it in the
dependency vector on your *_project.clj_* file:

[source, clojure]
----
[funcool/lentes "1.2.0"]
----


[[quick-start]]
== Quick Start

Do not be scared with the package name and its description. It is pretty
strighforward to use and understand. The lense consists in a couple of functions
responsibles for transform data structures in both directions.

=== Introduction to lenses

Let's create a couple of functions for getter and setter:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn my-getter
  [state]
  (:foo state))

(defn my-setter
  [state f]
  (update state :foo f))
----

Now, you can use that functions for access or modify data:

[source, clojure]
----
(def data {:foo 1 :bar 2})

(my-getter data)
;; => 1

(my-setter data inc)
;; => {:foo 2 :bar 2}
----

Now, we can generalize that using *lenses abstraction*:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[lentes.core :as l])

(def mylens (l/lens my-getter my-setter))

(l/focus mylens state)
;; => 1

(l/over mylens inc state)
;; => {:foo 2 :bar 2}
----

This all code can be awoided just using a one of the great bunch of helpers that
comes with lentes library out of the box (explained later):

[source, clojure]
----
(def mylens (l/key :foo))

(l/focus mylens state)
;; => 1

(l/over mylens inc state)
;; => {:foo 2 :bar 2}
----

=== Working with atoms

But, the best part is coming where you are using atoms for store your state and want
to create other (derived atoms) that acts like a limited version of the original
atom, also called materialized view. That you can do with `l/derive` function:

[source, clojure]
----
(def state1 (atom {:foo 1 :bar 1}))
(def state2 (l/derive (l/key :foo) state1))

(satisfies? IAtom state2)
;; => true

@state2
;; => 1

(swap! state2 inc)
@state2
;; => 2

@state1
;; => {:foo 2 :bar 2}
----

The derived atoms has very useful properties such as they are *lazy* (no code
executed until is really needed) and *smart* (does not trigger watches if the
focused data is not affected).

This is specially useful, when you want to create a materialized views of the global
state and use them together with link:https://github.com/tonsky/rum[rum] facilities
for react on atom changes, allowing components rerender only when the affected state
is changed.


== Reference

This section tries to explain the basic api of lenses and its composition that later
can be used for derive atoms from other atoms.


=== Builtin lenses

==== Identity

We'll start by using the most basic lens, the identity lens. We can get the value
a lens is focused on using the `focus` function in `lentes.core` ns:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[lentes.core :as l])

(l/focus l/id [0 1 2 3])
;; => [0 1 2 3]
----

We have two other primitives available: the `put` operation and `over`, which lets
us apply a function over the focused value of a lens:

[source, clojure]
----
(l/put l/id 42 [0 1 2 3])
;; => 42

(l/over l/id count [0 1 2 3])
;; => 4
----


==== Sequences

There are some builtin lenses that can be used out of the box with sequences such as
`fst`, `snd` and `nth`. Let see some examples on how them can be used:

.Example using `fst` lense
[source, clojure]
----
;; Focus over the first element of a vector
(l/focus l/fst [1 2 3])
;; => 1

;; Apply a function over first element of a vector
(l/over l/fst inc [1 2 3])
;; => [2 2 3]

;; Replace the first value of an element of a vector
(l/put l/fst 42 [1 2 3])
;; => [42 2 3]
----

.Example using the `nth` lense
[source, clojure]
----
(l/focus (l/nth 2) [1 2 3])
;; => 3

(l/over (l/nth 2) inc [1 2 3])
;; => [1 2 4]

(l/put (l/nth 2) 42 [1 2 3])
;; => [1 2 42]

(l/put l/each 2 [1 2 3])
;; => [2 2 2]

(l/focus (comp (l/key :a) l/each) {:a [1 2 3]})
;; => {:a [1 2 3]}

(l/over (comp (l/key :a) l/each) inc {:a [1 2 3]})
;; => {:a [2 3 4]}

(l/put (comp (l/key :a) l/each) 2 {:a [1 2 3]})
;; => {:a [2 2 2]}

----


==== Associative data structures

There's `key` and `select-keys` for focusing on one or multiple keys respectively:

.Example focusing in a specific key/keys of associative data structure
[source, clojure]
----
(l/focus (l/key :a) {:a 1 :b 2})
;; => 1

(l/over (l/key :a) str {:a 1 :b 2})
;; => {:a "1", :b 2}

(l/put (l/key :a) 42 {:a 1 :b 2})
;; => {:a 42, :b 2}

(l/focus (l/select-keys [:a]) {:a 1 :b 2})
;; => {:a 1}

(l/over (l/select-keys [:a :c])
        (fn [m]
         (zipmap (keys m) (repeat 42)))
        {:a 1 :b 2})
;; => {:b 2, :a 42}

(l/put (l/select-keys [:a :c])
       {:a 0}
       {:a 1 :b 2 :c 42})
;; => {:b 2, :a 0}
----

`in` for focusing on a path:

.Example focusing in neest data structures
[source, clojure]
----
(l/focus (l/in [:a :b])
         {:a {:b {:c 42}}})
;; => {:c 42}

(l/over (l/in [:a :b]) #(zipmap (vals %) (keys %))
        {:a {:b {:c 42}}})
;; => {:a {:b {42 :c}}}

(l/put (l/in [:a :b])
       42
       {:a {:b {:c 42}}})
;; => {:a {:b 42}}
----

Let's take a look at a combinator that will let us build a unit-conversion lens
called `units`. We have to supply a function to convert from unit `a` to unit `b`
and viceversa:

.Example definiting a "unit conversion" lense
[source, clojure]
----
(defn sec->min [sec] (/ sec 60))
(defn min->sec [min] (* min 60))

(def mins (l/units sec->min
                   min->sec))

(l/focus mins 120)
;; => 2

(l/put mins 3 120)
;; => 180

(l/over mins inc 60)
;; => 120
----


==== Conditionals

And conditional lenses that can be defined using a predicate function and returns a
lens that focuses in an element only if it passes the predicate:

.Example focusing using conditional lenses
[source, clojure]
----
(l/focus (l/passes even?) 2)
;; => 2

(l/over (l/passes even?) inc 2)
;; => 3

(l/put (l/passes even?) 42 2)
;; => 42

(l/focus (l/passes even?) 1)
;; => nil

(l/over (l/passes even?) inc 1)
;; => 1

(l/put (l/passes even?) 42 1)
;; => 1
----


=== Composition

One of the big advantatges of this lenses implementation is because it is
implemented in termps of function composition, much in the same line as
transducers. Let see a example:

[source, clojure]
----
(def my-lens (comp l/fst l/fst (l/nth 2)))

(def data
  [[0 1 2]
   [3 4 5]])

(l/focus my-lens data)
;; => 2

(l/put my-lens 42 data)
;; => [[0 1 42] [3 4 5]]
----

Lenses compose with regular function composition and, like transducers, the
combined lens runs from left to right.


== Developers Guide

=== Philosophy

Five most important rules:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.

All contributions to _lentes_ should keep these important rules in mind.
